I travel frequently and play on my friend's IE server from all over the place, on my laptop. My laptop takes about 6-7 minutes to load IE with all the modpacks. I get this EVERY time I move from one network to another (which is often) and I often have 20-40 minutes to play. . . between two meetings or at an airport. When I get this error and restarting eats a third of my play time, it makes me want to kick my computer. I can't believe there's NO way other than restarting the whole  
Hey guys, this has probably been asked before, but is it possible to play minecraft over LAN on a cracked version. Every time I try to join my friends game it gives me an error "Failed to login: Invalid session (Try restarting your game)". I am currently using tlauncher but I don't mind switching. I also want to play crazy craft (the one from hackpheonix) over LAN as well. I can also try using hamachi. I have tried disabling the firewall on both computers.

UPDATE 6 (29/5 23:24 UTC): Login issues should be resolved now. UPDATE 5 (28/5 10:02 UTC): Mojang is investigating issues with joining multiplayer games.

Hello again, so I can't seem to login to servers on Java Edition. I always get an error whenever trying to join a server. Error message reads "Failed to login: Invalid session \(Try restarting your game and the launcher\)" I've restarted my game, launcher, router and PC. Nothing I've tried is working. Any ideas on what I could do to fix this? Thanks! \ \ UPDATE:\ \ Whenever restarting the launcher, I'm automatically logged out my account with the message "Failed to refresh login. Please login.

I've tried restarting the game and launcher through task manager, I have restarted my PC, and I've uninstalled and reinstalled minecraft.

The error I get as I try to join the server is 'Failed to connect to server. Failed to login: Invalid Session (try restarting your game)' The game has been restarted repeatedly at this point, exited the launcher completely. I've been checking around, and the closest I can find to the actual issue is several people. Sorry to hear you’re having a problem, Lee. If repairing the disk in single user mode fails, it means one of two things. Either your hard drive itself is failing (a hardware failure), or the directory damage on your hard drive is beyond the capability of the built-in repair procedures Friday(10-Fev-2017): So i was playing in a server when i got kicked for afking (normal) so i reconnected back to the server but i got na error "Failed to login: Invalid Session" so i got off the launcher and i tried to login again into minecraft and i got "invalid password/username" error and i reentered the password like 10 times and still nothing.

If you get any tutoring from me, I am now giving the Core Nursing Fundamentals Hi, maybe you guys can help me determine what's going on? Me and my boyfriend are trying to connect over LAN, but we don't see each other's worlds (used Open to LAN option from a singleplayer world). Direct connect attempts don't work (with port number used too). we use the same version of Minecraft - PC 1.12.1 he has Win7, I have Win10 no antivirus firewall disabled, network set to private in Windows preferences, Java (javaw.exe) is in firewall exceptions set up static IP Network. 
Hi community, I wanted to check out this server after reading about it. Problem is I cannot connect to it. Here is my question, does one need a legit copy of Minecraft 1.8.8 to connect? I am trying with a cracked launcher and each time I try to connect it says, "Failed to login: Invalid session" Thanks in advance for any tips/info Update: inquiry has been resolved, one needs a legit client to connect to 2b2t for any other noobs that are curious, big thanks I used to make singleplayer worlds and then use Open to LAN option to play with my friend. She has laptop and is connected via WiFi. Recently I got new router and after that we cant play anymore. Im not 100% sure that router is the problem because we haven't played for like 6 months. Things I tried: Reinstall minecraft Update both computers java. Direct connect It doesnt find LAN servers, and when she connects by Ip it says failed to login invalid session (try restarting your game). Really, i don't know if this can be published here; If it can't, tell me and i will remove it before than a mod. Hello everybody, Here i come next to search and search in Internet and.(like anybody in this forums) I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING. Ok, my problem: My friend and me (No Premiums, Sorry, We don't have credit card :( ) tried to play in my world using Lan Server and Hamachi, but when he tries to enter in my world, he receives the message: Failed to login: Invalid Session(Try Restarting. My son has watched a couple of escape from jail type minigames on youtube and has been asking me for help to play them. I'd love to get him going but Im running into a problem. One obstacle is that we currently live in a motel (times are rough) so we share wifi with everyone and ports/services being blocked on the router might be the problem. I do not think this is the issue though because I was able to log into a random server for a brief amount of time earlier today. One server I found. As mentioned, we haven't been able to join each other. I've followed the instructions I've found in multiple places: Start as Single Player -gt Open to LAN -gtHave other person open as Multiplayer -gt Join Server Sometimes he shows up in the multiplayer list, but I never show up in his. When I attempt to join his, I get this error: gt java.net.connectexception connection timed out no further information I've spent the last couple hours trying to fix the issue. Here are the things. I have a legit copy of minecraft, no mods or anything, and when I go to multiplayer and add a server, it says: Failed to Connect To Server Failed to Login: Invalid Session (Try restarting your game) Well I've restarted my game, restarted my computer, signed out and back in, and nothing. I thought perhaps I was running the wrong version of minecraft, so I tried different versions, no help. The weird thing is I can connect to only one server. EDIT: So apparently I didn't have the default. 
So I'm running FTB Unleashed 1.1.2/MC1.5.2 and I had the server running for a while, but all of a sudden, a friend messages me (that uses the server), telling me that they can't get in due to "Invalid Username" and "Outdated client", and that the server has changed to a 1.6.7 server. I made sure that my server was shut down, passwords changed to a strong password (it was already strong to begin with), and began looking into the issue. This is what I got from the console when I began to start. So im trying to play minecraft. It has worked for me until yesterday, and from yesterday i can only access one server and the other one say: "Failed to login, invalid session (Try restarting your game)". So, whenever i go onto any survival world the world goes black like this: also, when i try and log onto any servers it gives me a message saying "Failed to login: Invalid session (try restarting your game)", and even when i restard minecraft it still gives me this error message. If anyone could help me with either of these bugs it would be greatly appreciated, thanks. 
I keep getting "Failed to login: Invalid session (try restarting your game)" after leaving minecraft up for a little bit when trying to log into my own server. I've heard people claim it could be because of bukkit or a hacked minecraft version, but I have neither of those. I use a legit version of minecraft and I don't have bukkit server, just a regular vanilla one. So what would be the problem? And no, reinstalling did nothing.
